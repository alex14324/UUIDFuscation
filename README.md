# UUID Obfuscation in Malware Development

Welcome to the UUID Obfuscation in Malware Development repository. This project explores techniques for obfuscating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) to enhance stealth and evade detection. UUID obfuscation is a technique used to mask or disguise UUIDs used in malware to obscure tracking and identification mechanisms.

## Overview

UUID obfuscation involves altering or disguising UUIDs to prevent easy identification and tracking. In malware development, obfuscating UUIDs can help in:

- **Concealing Identifiers**: Hiding the true UUIDs used for tracking or identifying malicious components.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Using methods such as encoding or encryption to obscure UUIDs and avoid detection by security systems.

This repository provides resources, examples, and tools related to UUID obfuscation.
